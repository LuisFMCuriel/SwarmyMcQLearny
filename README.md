# SwarmyMcQLearny
Towards swarm intelligence using deep reinforcement learning

## Overview
SwarmyMcQLearny is a library of deep reinforcement learning method that looks for optimum control of agents. The main objective of this project is to achieve swarm intelligence to solve
a variaty of tasks. The repository will collect DRL algorithms to compare the op
