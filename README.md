# SwarmyMcQLearny
Towards swarm intelligence using deep reinforcement learning

## Overview
SwarmyMcQLearny is a library of deep reinforcement learning method that looks for optimum control of agents. The main objective of this project is to achieve swarm intelligence to solve
a variaty of tasks. The repository will collect DRL algorithms to compare the op

## Getting started
Use the yaml files deposited in SwarmyMcQLearny/environments/ with anaconda to download the python packages needed to run the models. 
Run the next command in a terminal or an Anaconda prompt to create the environment from the yml file.
conda env create -f environment.yml
