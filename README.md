# SwarmyMcQLearny
Towards swarm intelligence using deep reinforcement learning

## Overview
SwarmyMcQLearny is a library for deep reinforcement learning method that looks for optimum control of agents. The main objective of this project is to achieve swarm intelligence to solve
a variaty of tasks. The repository will collect DRL algorithms to compare the the performance of the algorithms on different tasks. The algorithms are implemented in PyTorch and tenssorflow.
The reason why we use both frameworks is to facilitate the use of the algorithms for the user. The algorithms are implemented in PyTorch and tensorflow. The reason why we use both frameworks is to facilitate the use of the algorithms for the user in case
the user is more familiar with one of the frameworks.

## Getting started
Use the yaml files deposited in SwarmyMcQLearny/environments/ with anaconda to download the python packages needed to run the models. 
Run the next command in a terminal or an Anaconda prompt to create the environment from the yml file.
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
